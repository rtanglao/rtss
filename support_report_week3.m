Recently, Mozilla announced the new Firefox Accounts system (which is replacing the old Firefox Sync Account) and I created a Firefox Account for my laptop Nightly installation. Since the new Firefox Account doesn't work with the old Firefox Sync Account, I replaced my Android installation of Firefox Beta with Firefox Nightly and signed into Firefox Account on my Android. However, when I attempt to send a tab from my Android installation to my laptop installation using the "Share to Nightly" intent, Nightly asks me to set up a Sync account, which is impossible to complete in my laptop Nightly installation. I've tried replacing my Android Nightly installation with an Android Aurora installation, but the same problem occurs."),

The newly-downloaded Firefox 27.0 browser did a great job when displaying a page using portrait mode.  When I rotated the phone to landscape mode, the displayed data went fuzzy and repeated itself three times across the width of the screen.  This happened with some other pages I checked, including the "Bookmarks | About Firefox" page.  By rotating the phone back and forth, I was also able to get it to mess up the display once in the portrait mode.  This characteristic makes Firefox pretty much useless as a browser on this phone.  Feature or bug???"),
