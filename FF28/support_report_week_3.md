There is no moral question that even comes up with race and ethnic origin so it is not appropriate to consider any group characterized by a behavior, sexual or otherwise, as a bonafide minority group. Supporting normal marriage does not indicate bigotry as in hate for gay people , it just says that marriage is not appropriate for gay couples because it gives defacto credibility to a behavior approximately half the nation still considers immoral. If we are to be a truly tolerant society then we need to be tolerant of all opinions , both liberal and conservative. Otherwise we become like the communist countries and totalitarian states where only one opinion is acceptable. I am sorry Mozilla caved to the Gaystopo.
