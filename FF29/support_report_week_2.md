Please help me out!](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1000557 "I cannot download/install Adobe Flash Player on Mozilla Browser and I really need it to stream local National TV Channel for news etc etc.and I couldn't find it on Google Play neither
I have been trying for a long time but cannot manage on my own so would appreciate it very much if you could help me sort this out to finally manage to download/install Latest Adobe Flash Player. As a matter of fact I have been using your Browser  as default one on my laptop for quite a long time and I had never found it difficult to install the Adobe Flash Player there or even update it from time to time! Really cannot understand why I'm finding all this difficulty now to install on my Samsung S4 device which I bought very recently! Again thanks for helping me out and please explain to me in simple language what steps to take to finally manage to install this blessed Adobe Flash Player! Wishing you as always the BEST for future Success for Mozilla Browser & thanks very much for the latest Version of a fantastic browser. Fondest regards to all The Team at Mozilla!
